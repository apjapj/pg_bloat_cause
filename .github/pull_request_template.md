<!--
Kept short for the same reason as the issue template: a long form gets filled in with "N/A"
and tells us nothing. What we cannot work out for ourselves is what you were trying to do
and what you expected, so those are the only required fields.

**What this changes, and why**

<!-- One or two sentences. Link the issue if there is one. -->

**How it was verified**

<!--
Say what you ran and what it printed. If you changed a check, say you saw it fail before
the change and pass after: CONTRIBUTING.md's "Proving a check fails" has the method, and a
check that was never seen to fail is not evidence that it can.
-->

- [ ] `make lint` passes
- [ ] the tests pass on PostgreSQL 14 and 18
- [ ] if this changes what a scenario prints, `scenarios/evidence/` has been regenerated
      **and the output was the same on three consecutive runs**, because CI compares the
      evidence byte for byte and a non-deterministic capture is a red run nobody can fix
- [ ] if a file was hand-copied into a container, the `md5sum` of the destination was
      compared with the source, per [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#proving-a-check-fails)
- [ ] if this changes user-visible text, `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry and the version was incremented

<!--
Tick what applies and leave the rest. An unticked box is not a problem; a ticked box that
was never run is, because it reads as evidence that nothing broke and we will not
re-check it.

**Anything a reviewer should know before reading the diff**

<!-- A cause that stops being detectable, a grant that changes, a scenario that skips itself here and why. -->
